This application navigates between 4 different components:

1) Home

    The Home component enables the user to get weather information based on their location.
    The weather data is fetched from the openweathermap API (https://openweathermap.org/api)
    
    This component also provides the user with some of the latest news headlines from the BBC, fetched from https://newsapi.org/

2) Todo  List

    This component lets the user curate a todo-list where they can add and remove todo items from the list and also filter the todo list based on different categories.

3) Shopping List

     Similarly to the previous component, this component lets the user curate a shopping list where they can add and remove  items from the list and also filter the list based on different categories.

4) Pomodoro Timer

    This last component contains a timer feature that supports the pomodoro technique which traditionally breaks down work into 25-minute intervals, separated by 5-minute breaks.
